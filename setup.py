The two channels of our Siamese network are based on the VGG16 architecture with shared weights. Changes between the target and reference images are detected with a fully connected decision network that was trained on DIRSIG simulated samples and achieved a high detection rate. Alternatively, a change detection approach based on Euclidean distance between deep convolutional features achieved very good results with minimal supervision.",
